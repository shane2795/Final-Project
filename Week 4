Introduction/Business Problem

For my capstone project I will be using the Foursquare Api location data to analyse what part of my home city (Dublin, Ireland) would be the best place to open a new
Italian resturant. This project will be designed from the perspective of trying to convince the stakeholders (owners of resturant) that they should open a new 
restuarant in Dublin. I will be assuming the owners already have successfull restuarants in other parts of the country and as a result there is no desperate need to 
open a new restuarant. However, my aim will be to put forward a compelling enough case to prove that there is a gap in the market for a new Italian resturant in Dublin
and to show the stakeholders that there is good reason to believe that the new restuarant will be a success. 


Data

For the purposes of this assignment I will be using the Foursquare Api location data to bring up other resturants (Italian & non-Italian) in the city to first see the
geographical spread. If there is a part of the city without an Italian restaurant then we should consider that particular location. I will also be using the 
customer reviews data to see if other resturants in the area have a good reputation, if there's an area without an Italian restuarant but the restuarants in that area
have really high reviews then it may be tough to convince local consumers to switch - although people would most likely come to the resturant to "try it out", repeat 
business is what will make the restuarant successfull and if consumers already have a very high opinion of the competition that area may not be suitable.
On the other hand, if there's an area with Italian restuarants but with average reviews then customers may be willing to consider a new alterative. 
Finally I will present my finding and offer recommendations based on the results
